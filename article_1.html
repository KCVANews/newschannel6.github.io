            <p>The DOG beach sand project has failed after much of the sand washed away. This is coming right after they just finished filling in the beach with new sand to expand the beach. Many say this is a big waste of money and sand. The original project made it so you can walk around from the road to del mar beach but the sand that made this possible has been washed away. One more thing that has developed in the area is a strong rip current which could end up being dangerous.</p>
