            <h2>Tijuana Sewage Crisis Reaches Del Mar</h2>
            <p>Since October 2023, the Tijuana sewage crisis has been intoxicating the waters of San Diego by dumping millions of gallons of untreated sewage and hazardous material into the water. This has been making it dangerous to swim in the waters at certain beaches such as Imperial Beach and Coronado Beach. As of recently, the sewage has begun to reach Del Mar, making some of the water not only smell horrible but also become dangerous to swim in. As of right now, we advise that you stay out of the waters in Dog Beach. But the waters at Del Mar should still be safe to swim in, but this could change very soon. As of September 16, 2024, over 40.4 million gallons of sewage have been dumped into the Pacific Ocean finding its way into our San Diego life preventing us from using our beaches.</p>
