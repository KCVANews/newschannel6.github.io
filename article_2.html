            <p>The Penguin Plunge made its 37 annual appearance in Del Mar at 11am. This event took place on 17th street and had over 1,000 people. In this event you run into the 57*  ocean like a penguin to celebrate the new year. Once you have completed the challenge, you will receive a certificate proving you have done the challenge and a donut with coffee. “It was really cold and fun.” a kid who had completed the challenge told me. Another attendee said  “When I first went in, I didn't feel that cold but when the waves started hitting you, it actually got pretty hard to breathe.” So next year, consider taking on the challenge of the Penguin Plunge and have a fresh start to the new year.</p>
